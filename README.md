# Ozone Explained

This repository contains the source materials of Apache Hadoop Ozone related videos.

 * [Ozone Explained](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCaV-jpCBO8UK5Ged2A_iv3eHuozzMsYv): about architecture, design consideration
 * [Ozone Development](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCaV-jpCBO8U_WqyySszmbmnL-dhlzF6o): about development specific topics.

 Feel free to reuse any of the materials.

## How to contribute

 Contributions is open for anyone.

  1. If you have questions / ideas to cover, please open an issue (or PR to modify IDEAS.txt)
  2. If you are willing to create new episodes, please use the existing presentations as a template (LibreOffice)

Other ideas to contribute:

 * create subtitles in different languages
 * remake any of the videos in different language

## Used tools

I prefer to use only Open Source tools to create the videos to make it easier to reuse / remix source materials.

 * presentations are created with Libre Office (Using [Montserrat fonts](https://github.com/JulietaUla/Montserrat))
 * diagrams (whiteboards) are created with draw.io (available for both offline and online usage)
 * less relevant, but videos are recorded by Obs (using only very small set of the features)
